# AI-Powered Task Planner 🧠✅

This project is an **AI-assisted task planner web application** built with FastAPI and HTML/CSS. Users enter a **topic**, and the app uses the **Google Gemini API** to generate a description and a to-do list, which is then stored in a local database.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Accepts a simple title input from the user
- 🤖 Generates a relevant description and to-do list using the Gemini API
- 🗂️ Stores tasks in a local database
- 🌐 Web interface built with HTML/CSS
- 🐳 Docker support for easy deployment
